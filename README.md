### Abstract
The digitization of money has transformed the technological substrate of finance,
but it has not altered the fundamental role of monetary systems as instruments of
geopolitical order. This paper analyzes the strategic fork confronting the United States:
whether global digital settlement converges on a non-sovereign protocol such as Bit-
coin or remains anchored in sovereign monetary infrastructure via a U.S. central bank
digital currency (USCBDC). Drawing on international political economy, monetary
history, and mechanism design, the paper argues that Bitcoin and a U.S. CBDC serve
orthogonal functions. Bitcoin is optimally suited as a domestic autonomy rail, while a
U.S. CBDC is necessary to preserve cross-border enforcement, sanctions credibility, and
war deterrence. A historical literature review of Germany’s 1930s exchange controls
provides a stress test for dual-rail systems. The paper formalizes the design problem
using mechanism design and game theory, deriving equilibrium conditions under which
a dual-rail architecture can preserve both civil legitimacy and geopolitical stability.
